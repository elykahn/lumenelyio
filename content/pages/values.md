A business without an established set of values will inevitably be faced, either as a group or individually, with questions of great import and ethical, moral or strategic dubitability and making such decisions ad hoc is completely understandable for a person, it's another story for a business. Furthermore, the more clarity one can have about what matters most to them in the pursuit of a project or in the grand project of life, the better equipped they will be to make difficult decisions in high-pressure situations with confidence and grace. 

With that in mind, here are the guiding principles and values of this business:  
## **Values**

**For:** People with problems operating their devices, computers and mobile  
**Who are dissatisfied with**: Terrible customer service, Genius Bars & Floundering Around hoping to stumble upon the answer  
**We offer**: Personalized, one-on-one guidance to help you do whatever it is that matters to you without making any kind of judgement or criticism for what you do or donâ€™t know  
**Unlike**: The rest of the support infrastructure that is anything but helpful
